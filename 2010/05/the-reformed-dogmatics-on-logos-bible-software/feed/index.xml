		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tim,

Glad you found the site! 

For my two cents on where to begin in Bavinck&#039;s works, if you are just jumping in, you may enjoy starting with Bavinck&#039;s own summary of his 4 vol. Dogmatics, entitled, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heritagebooks.org/products/Our-Reasonable-Faith.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Our Reasonable Faith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Another of his shorter works, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archive.org/details/sacrificeofprais00bavi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Sacrifice of Praise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is freely available online, as is his &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=wS03AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=bavinck%20philosophy%20of%20revelation&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Philosophy of Revelation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. If you already have vol. 2 and have already read sections 1-3, I&#039;d continue on into the subsequent sections on creation and anthropology.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, I&#039;ve read the section of Bavinck&#039;s RD on theology proper, which was great! Where would you suggest I start in the full 4-vol set? What would give me a taste of Bavinck in particular?

Also, I was excited to find this blog... I&#039;ve already told a number of people about it!

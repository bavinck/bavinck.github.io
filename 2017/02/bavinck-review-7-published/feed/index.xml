		<description><![CDATA[Just want to say how much I appreciate the availability of a scholarly EJournal at no cost! I have downloaded all the Journals since Volume 1. The Dutch Reformed tradition is rich and applicable today. I have read so much of Kuyper&#039;s works and has been a pleasure reading Bavinck! Thank you again!]]></description>

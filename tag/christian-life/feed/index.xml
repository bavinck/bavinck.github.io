<p>If you have had the privilege of crossing paths with Bavinck Society member <a href="http://sovgraceto.org/meet-our-pastor/">Tim Kerr</a>, it is likely that two things characterized your experience: first, you came away deeply encouraged in the faith; second, you were prayed for sincerely before you departed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.takewordswithyou.com/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2362" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/take-words-with-you-207x300.png" alt="take-words-with-you" width="207" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/take-words-with-you-207x300.png 207w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/take-words-with-you.png 345w" sizes="(max-width: 207px) 100vw, 207px" /></a>In hopes of further multiplying this privilege, the Bavinck Institute is pleased to call your attention to the 5th edition of Pastor Kerr’s <em><a href="http://www.takewordswithyou.com/">Take Words with You: Scripture Promises &amp; Prayers / A Manual for Intercession</a></em> (2015). In this work Pastor Kerr uses a simple five-step method to help believers to pray regularly, both individually and corporately, according to God’s promises and prayers in Holy Scripture (1 John 5:14).</p>
<p>To borrow a line from Herman Bavinck (<em>RD </em>4:225), this manual puts into practice the rock solid biblical teaching that believers in Jesus Christ</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">do not pray in doubt and despair; they do not pray as though they are no longer children of God and again face eternal damnation; [rather] they pray from within the faith as children to the Father who is in heaven, and say Amen to their prayer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">This faith-filled “Amen-ing”—the bold response of a heart whose prayers in Jesus’s name proceed from God, are prayed through God, and return unto God—is the aim of this faith-fueling guidebook.</p>
<p class="p1">For an intro to the manual, <a href="http://www.takewordswithyou.com/purpose/">read Pastor Kerr’s answers</a> to these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is it needed?</li>
<li>Who is it for?</li>
<li>How is this book different from similar manuals?</li>

<p>The Bavinck Institute is pleased to announce Professor John Bolt’s latest publication on Herman Bavinck: <cite><a href="//www.crossway.org/books/bavinck-on-the-christian-life-tpb/">Bavinck on the Christian Life: Following Jesus in Faithful Service</a></cite> (Wheaton: Crossway, 2015); in print and ebook via <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bavinck-Christian-Life-Following-Theologians/dp/1433540746/">Amazon</a>, <a href="//books.google.com/books?id=1KFZCgAAQBAJ">Google Books</a>, <a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/bavinck-on-the-christian-life-following-jesus-in-faithful-service-john-bolt-9781433540745">WTS books</a>.</p>
<p>“The question I want to pose at the very beginning of a volume on Herman Bavinck’s understanding of the Christian life,” writes Bolt in the preface,</p>
<blockquote><p>is whether this great Reformed theologian, broadly celebrated for his erudition and theological genius, practiced what he preached and taught. How does his theology relate to his ethics? In other words, was his great mind combined with a warm heart for the Lord and a commitment to a life of Christian service? Does his life stand up to the scrutiny of his own theology?</p>
<p>It is my honor and pleasure in the pages that follow to provide the evidence for a positive answer to these queries. The opening chapter is an exploration of Bavinck’s own desire, frequently expressed during the years he was a student at the University of Leiden, “to be a worthy follower of Jesus.”</p>
<p>Part 1 explores the basis of Bavinck’s theology of Christian discipleship, which can be summarized especially under the rubrics of creation/law and union with Christ. The three chapters of this foundational section are followed by two chapters describing the shape of Christian discipleship in terms of the imitation of Christ and sketching out the contours of Bavinck’s worldview.</p>
<p>The remaining four chapters apply this vision concretely in marriage and family, work and vocation, culture and education, and finally, civil society. The volume concludes with Bavinck’s only published sermon—on 1 John 5:4b—as a summary statement of triumphant Christian discipleship. My translation of this sermon into English was prepared specifically for this volume. Taken together, the chapters of this volume serve as an introduction to and brief primer of Herman Bavinck’s thought.</p></blockquote>

<p>Professor Bolt defended his original dissertation in 1982 at the University of St. Michael&#8217;s College, Toronto, under the title, ”The Imitation of Christ Theme in the Cultural-Ethical Ideal of Herman Bavinck.” For the published edition he has updated the scholarship and added a concluding chapter on application and relevance. Also, he has included the first available English translations of Bavinck’s two imitation articles of 1885/86 and 1918.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bolt’s investigation of Bavinck’s essays on the imitation of Christ . . . immerses us in some of the most important aspects of the Christianity and culture debate. What is the relationship of God’s work of creation to his work of redemption? What is the relationship of nature and grace? What is the significance of common grace and natural law? What is the relationship of the Old Testament law, as summarized in the Decalogue, to New Testament ethics, especially as set forth in the Sermon on the Mount? Can the Sermon on the Mount really direct our social-cultural life and, if so, how? These will undoubtedly remain central questions to discussions about Christian cultural activity, and Bolt reflects on all of them as he expounds Bavinck’s essays. I predict that his conclusions will surprise many readers, challenge simplistic assumptions about Bavinck’s view of culture, and inspire many people to read Bavinck anew. (David VanDrunen, &#8220;Forward,&#8221; v–vi)</p></blockquote>
